# 2–3 minute demo script (record this)

1) Start the agent in dev mode:
   - `python agent.py dev`

2) Open LiveKit Agents Playground and connect to your agent.

3) Say:
   - “Hi — can you help me book an HVAC appointment?”

4) Answer the agent’s questions (name, phone, date/time window, zip code, issue).

5) Watch the console log for a line that starts with:
   - `BOOKING_PAYLOAD=...`

6) End with:
   - “Great, thank you!”

Tip: Keep the whole video under 3 minutes. Show the repo README briefly, then the live interaction.
